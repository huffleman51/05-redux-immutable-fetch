Tutorial that I followed is [here](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch/blob/master/tutorial/04-webpack-react-hmr.md#readme).

# What I learned in this module

1. Webpack is a module bundler. It takes a whole bunch of various source files, processes them, and assembles them into one (usually) JavaScript file called a bundle, which is the only file your client will execute. 
1. Create a webpack.config.babel.js file. This file is used to describe how our bundle should be assembled.
1. If you want to use some of the most recent ES features in your client code, like Promises, you need to include the Babel Polyfill before anything else in your bundle.
1. Additional tasks can be added to the package.json as needed to assist your development
1. React is a library for building user interfaces by Facebook. It uses the JSX syntax to represent HTML elements and components while leveraging the power of JavaScript.
1. Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a powerful Webpack feature to replace a module on the fly without reloading the entire page.
